Expanded 4-byte payload w/checksum to allow:
* 8-bit SENDER ID instead of 4-bits
* Checksum is now 8-bits
* Data payload is now 16 bits instead of 8-bits

Full details on original implementation is available on the [Arduino Manchester Encoding site](http://mchr3k.github.com/arduino-libs-manchester/)
